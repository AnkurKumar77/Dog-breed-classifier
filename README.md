# Dog-breed-classifier

### Project Summary

In this project, we build a pipeline which can process images of dogs given by the user. 
The algorithm will give an estimate for the dog's breed. If the image includes a human, then the algorithm will give the resembling dog breed.

The project consists of the following steps:

### Step 1:
Detecting presence of human faces in the given image.

### Step 2:
Detecting presence of dog in the given image.

### Step 3: 
Building a CNN architecture from scratch for predicting dog breeds.

### Step 4:
Using transfer learning to create a CNN to classify dog Breeds.
